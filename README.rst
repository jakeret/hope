**HOPE** is a specialized method-at-a-time JIT compiler written in Python for
translating Python source code into C++ and compiles this at runtime. In
contrast to other existing JIT compliers, which are designed for general
purpose, we have focused our development of the subset of the Python language
that is most relevant for astrophysical calculations. By concentrating on this
subset, **HOPE** is able to achieve the highest possible performance.


By using **HOPE**, the user can benefit from being able to write common
numerical code in Python and having the performance of compiled implementation.
To enable the **HOPE** JIT compilation, the user needs to add a decorator to
the function definition. The package does not require additional information,
which ensures that **HOPE** is as non-intrusive as possible:

.. code-block:: python

    from hope import jit

    @jit
    def sum(x, y):
        return x + y


The **HOPE** package has been developed at ETH Zurich in the `Software Lab of
the Cosmology Research Group
<http://www.cosmology.ethz.ch/research/software-lab.html>`_ of the `ETH
Institute of Astronomy <http://www.astro.ethz.ch/>`_, and is now publicly
available at `GitHub <https://github.com/cosmo-ethz/hope>`_.

Further information on the package can be found in our `paper
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133714000687>`_,  on
`readthedocs.org <http://hope.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_  and on our
`website <http://hope.phys.ethz.ch>`_.
